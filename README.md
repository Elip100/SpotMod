## Usage
To use the tool, download the latest version [here](https://github.com/Elip100/SpotMod/releases) and run it (Windows only). Spotify must have been downloaded from the Spotify website (not the Microsoft Store). If you installed Spotify from the Microsoft Store, uninstall it and click "Download directly from Spotify" on [this page](https://www.spotify.com/download/windows/).

## Updating
To update SpotMod, uninstall the old patch and install the new one with the new injector.
__Do not just use the "Re-patch" option in the new injector. That is for when Spotify updates, not SpotMod!__
