If you installed Spotify from the Microsoft Store, uninstall it and click "Download directly from Spotify" on [this page](https://www.spotify.com/download/windows/).

## Updating
To update SpotMod, [download the new injector EXE file](https://github.com/Elip100/SpotMod/releases) and replace the old one. _Only download and replace the EXE when updating, not the ZIP file!_ As soon as you open the new injector, you will be prompted to update the loader. Choose yes and it will automatically update while keeping all of your mods.
